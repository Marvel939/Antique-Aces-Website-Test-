                    <p>In 1906, the government stressed using hallmarks to track the purity of gold. So,
                        brands came up with unique symbols as their purity marks. However, the hallmarking
                        process had existed long before the 1900s. So let’s see how to identify such marks
                        with jewelry’s brand and materials.
                    </p>
                    <p>Vintage hallmarks help antique lovers identify the jewelry’s materials, purity,
                        brands & makers in no time.
                        Antique jewelry has six types of hallmarks – Makers & Trademarks for the brand,
                        Purity & Assay marks for the materials, and Date Letter & Duty marks for the age.

                    <h1>When Did Vintage Hallmarks Evolve & How?</h1>
                    <p>The first collectible hallmarks are from King Edward’s era in the 1300s. But even
                        before that, some crude silver marks from 4th-century Egypt have been found. These
                        were simple bar/line symbols, so people often mistook them for manufacturing
                        defects.</p>
                    <p>Then, in the 1300s, Edward 1 introduced punching marks. Like, he used typical
                        screwdrivers and chisels to emboss the jewelry. Also, they had a leopard or lion
                        face to show their royalty.
                    </p>
                    <p>But then all the makers copied this mark, and there was confusion!

                        So, by the 1830s, each brand used a different hallmark. Yes, there were some common
                        ones for gold, but all had different finishes. In fact, in 1906, the US enforced a
                        compulsory hallmark act to control the metal’s purity. And makers use them even
                        today!
