                            <p>The Morgan Silver Dollar was first minted in 1878 following the passage of the
                                Bland-Allison Act that forced the US treasury to buy $2 million to $4 million worth of
                                silver each month and circulate them as coins. </p>

                            <p>The 1879 issue was the second year of production for this American dollar coin. Morgan
                                Dollars were produced at different mints and circulated across the States until 1921
                                when they were finally replaced by the Peace Dollars, featuring new Liberty and Eagle
                                designs.</p>
