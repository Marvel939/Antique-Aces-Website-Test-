              <h1>History of the Buffalo Nickels</h1>
              <p>The first Buffalo Nickel coins, designed by James Earle Fraser, were circulated in 1913. They featured
                a Native American’s profile on the front and an American bison or buffalo on the reverse. Two types were
                circulated: Type I with Raised Ground and Type II with Regular Strike. </p><br>
              <p>Within a few years, minor changes were made to the Buffalo Nickel; the word “Liberty” was made more
                prominent and moved. 1936 is the year in which the highest number of Buffalo nickels were minted.
                Finally, due to declining popularity in the coming years, the Jefferson Nickel replaced the Buffalo
                Nickel in 1938 and is circulated to date!</p><br>
              <h1>Identifying a 1936 Buffalo Nickel (Design & Composition)</h1>
              <p>The 1936 Buffalo Nickel can be easily identified by its unique American Man and Bison design, suggested
                by sculptor James Earle Fraser:</p>
