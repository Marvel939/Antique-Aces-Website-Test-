                                    <p>While all 1943-D Lincoln Wheat Cent were steel, about 40 coins were
                                        accidentally struck on a bronze/copper planchet. These 1943-D copper cents
                                        are one of the most valuable coins, and only about thirteen such coins are
                                        reportedly found as of today.

                                <p>During the minting of the 1944 wheat pennies, the makers at all three mints
                                    somehow stuffed the leftover zinc-coated steel planchets from the 1942 war cent
                                    series. The result was a rare 1944 Steel Wheat Penny. Due to the silvery color
                                    of steel, they became popular as “1944 Silver pennies.”</p>
                                <p>Only around thirty 1944 steel (Silver) pennies, seven 1944-D steel pennies, and
                                    two 1944-S steel wheat pennies have been found as of now. A rare PCGS-graded
                                    MS-64 1944-S steel penny was auctioned for $408,000 at Heritage Auctions.
