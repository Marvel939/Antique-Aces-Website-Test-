                            <p><span class="firstcharacter">W</span>We have all grown up playing with marbles,
                                right?
                                So, it’s nothing new! But, what you might not know is that your vintage marbles
                                might
                                sell for up to $1000 at any auction. No, we aren’t joking! You just need to see if
                                they
                                are old and handblown, and if they are, you can hit it rich!</p>

                            <p>Antique marbles have six types based on the swirls and core designs. Of these, the
                                Sulphide, Onion skin, and Lutz marbles are the most precious! </p>

                            <p>Identifying old marbles is not that confusing! First, just see if it’s deformed and
                                has a
                                deep pontil on its edge. Next, check if it has patchwork and striped designs on its
                                surface. If yes, you have an antique marble, valuing $40 – 50. If not, it might be
                                new,
                                costing $1-2!</p>

                            <h1>History & Evolution of Antique Marbles</h1>
                            <p>The origin of playing marbles has no concrete theory! Some say it’s from Ancient
                                Egypt,
                                while others trace it to Nepal. But roughly, they are about 4500 years old. So,
                                you’ll
                                find rare, aged stone walls and chisels with these.</p>
                            <p>It was in the 1800s that SC Dyke made the first ceramic marbles! He also hand-painted
                                them with local flowers and motifs. But these clay marbles were rough and heavy!
                                Plus,
                                they broke soon so their use went down. No wonder these marbles are rare today!
                            </p>

                            <p>Then, it was the era of glass! Makers tried using molten and silicate glass for
                                superior
                                marbles. Plus, they added thick walls and animal motifs for decoration. But these
                                became
                                very common among kids! So, you’ll get them at a low cost easily!</p>
