                            <p><span class="firstcharacter">W</span>Walt Disney Studios has given animated films a
                                whole new direction since releasing its first film, “Snow White and the Seven
                                Dwarfs.” Following this, it blessed cartoon lovers with an array of unforgettable
                                films, such as Robin Hood, The Jungle Book, Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, and
                                many more. </p>

                                <p>From 1937 to the early 2000s, Disney’s most classic animated films were released
                                    on VHS (Video Home System that uses analog video recording cassettes with
                                    magnetic tapes). Some of these VHSs were part of special Walt Disney
                                    collections. <br>Since VHSs were discontinued after the evolution of DVDs, these
                                    vintage Disney VHS tapes have become a collectible for die-hard Disney fans!

                            <figure class="my-4">

                                <p>Black Diamond Tapes: Several Disney VHS tapes were released as a part of the
                                    “Walt Disney Classics” home video series, which is also known as the “Black
                                    Diamond Collection.” These tapes can be identified by the iconic Black Diamond
                                    label reading “The Classics” on the cassette cases.<br>

                                    Older, Rarer & Lesser Known Films: While popular Disney film tapes are mostly
                                    more sought-after, the less popular films may also fetch an unexpected price as
                                    they might be hard to find.<br>
                                    Original Clamshell Cases: Naturally, Disney VHSs with original, unopened cases
                                    are valued more. Factory-sealed clamshell cases are a solid attraction for
                                    Disney lovers as a sign of the company’s merchandise.

                            <h1>1. Disney Pixar Cars (Sold for $12,000)</h1>
                            <p>Arguably considered one of the last Disney VHS tapes, a 2007 Disney Pixar Cars tape
                                sold for a whopping $12,000 on eBay, registering itself as the most expensive Disney
                                VHS tape ever sold.

                                These tapes were released in 2007 as a limited edition, making them quite rare. The
                                tape case is labeled VGA 85+ (GOLD) (IGS DMC) with a visible barcode which justifies
                                its stunning price.</p>
                            <h1>2. Beauty and the Beast (Sold for 37,777)</h1>
                            <p>If you are a Beauty and the Beast fan, this collectible VHS is for you! Walt Disney
                                Home Video (aka Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment) released the film to VHS
                                under the Walt Disney Classics video series in 1992. The studio later released the
                                “work-in-progress” version of the film, which broke sales records.
                            </p>
                            <p>In 2002, the new “Beauty and the Beast: Special Edition,” featuring the film in the

                                today if you’re lucky.
